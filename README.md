# Connhex Edge Examples

A collection of example services demonstrating how to interact with the Connhex Edge agent in different programming languages.

These examples show best practices and common patterns for building services that communicate with the Connhex Cloud through Connhex Edge.

## Overview

Connhex Edge is a software component that runs on edge devices and facilitates communication between the devices and Connhex Cloud.

You can find more information about how to install and use the Connhex Edge in its [official documentation](https://connhex.com/docs/edge/intro).

This repository provides reference implementations and examples to help developers:

- build services that communicate with the Edge agent;
- implement proper service lifecycle management;
- follow best practices for edge device integration.
